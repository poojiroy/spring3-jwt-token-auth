# Spring JWT Token Authentication

This is a simple Spring Boot application that demonstrates how to implement JWT token-based authentication for securing your RESTful APIs. JWT is a popular authentication method for stateless applications and provides a secure way to authenticate users and ensure data integrity.

# Features

User registration and authentication.
Generation of JWT tokens upon successful login.
Securing API endpoints using JWT tokens.
Basic user management with a sample User model.
Custom JWT token provider and security configuration.

# Configuration

Configure your database settings in application.properties or application.yml.
Customize the security configuration in JwtConfig.java.

# Endpoints

/auth/create-user - Register a new user.
/auth/login - Authenticate and generate a JWT token.
/home/users- A secure endpoint that requires a valid JWT token for access.

# Testing

You can test the API endpoints using tools like Postman or curl. Be sure to include the JWT token in the Authorization header when accessing secure endpoints.

# Deployment

To deploy this application to production, follow standard deployment practices for Spring Boot applications. Consider using a production database, securing sensitive data, and implementing proper error handling.

# Security Considerations

Keep your JWT secret key secure and never expose it in your code.
Implement token expiration to enhance security.
Consider implementing user roles and permissions for fine-grained access control.
Always validate and sanitize user inputs to prevent security vulnerabilities.
